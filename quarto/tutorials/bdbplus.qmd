# *BDB* combined with *Strong*


:::{.callout-note title="Summary"}
Use the `bdbplus` function to retrieve articles from *BDB* together with data from Strong's *Concordance*
:::

## Combine articles in *BDB* with data from Strong

Find articles in *BDB* that Sefaria indexes a Hebrew word to, and join a list of records from Strong's *Concordance*. The result is a Vector of `BDBplus`s.

```{julia}
using BrownDriverBriggs 
plusentries = bdbplus("בָּרָ֣א")
```

```{julia}
typeof(plusentries)
```

The BDB articles are the same ones you would find if you used the `bdb` function with a token: you can also used `bdb` to extract the articles from a `BDBplus` object.

```{julia}
bdb.(plusentries)
```

Similarly, the `bdbid` function extracts the ID for the BDB article.  You can easily prove that the two lists have identical IDs:


```{julia}
bdbid.(plusentries) == id.(bdb("בָּרָ֣א"))
```
