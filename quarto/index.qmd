# BrownDriverBriggs.jl

`BrownDriverBriggs` is a light wrapper around [Sefaria's API](https://developers.sefaria.org/reference/getting-started-with-your-api).

It uses the endpoint at `https://www.sefaria.org/api/words` to retrieve articles from Sefaria's digital version of Brown, Driver and Brigg's *A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament*. `BrownDriverBriggs` provides a Julia model for articles and sections of articles, and functions for working with them.
