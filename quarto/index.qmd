# BrownDriverBriggs.jl

`BrownDriverBriggs` is a light wrapper around [Sefaria's API](https://developers.sefaria.org/reference/getting-started-with-your-api).

It uses the endpoint at `https://www.sefaria.org/api/words` to retrieve articles from [Sefaria](https://www.sefaria.org)'s digital version of Brown, Driver and Brigg's *A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament* and extracts from 
*Strong's Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible with Greek and Hebrew Dictionary* prepared by the [Blue Letter Bible](https://www.blueletterbible.org).


`BrownDriverBriggs` provides a Julia model for articles and sections of articles in *BDB* and for related information in *Strong*.
