# Filter *BDB* articles using the part of speech designation from *Strong*

Let's start with *BDB* plus Strong data for a token:

```{julia}
using BrownDriverBriggs 
plusentries = bdbplus("בָּרָ֣א")
```

Let's separate out those *BDB* articles that Strong identifies as verb forms. For each entry in `plusentries`, we  therefore want to see if it has a part of speech value of `v` in any of its associated Strong record.


```{julia}
verbarticles = filter(plusentries) do plusentry
    strongs = strong(plusentry)
    !isempty(filter(st -> pos(st) == "v", strongs))
end
```   


We can extract the BDB articles, and format them as HTML.

```{julia}
bdbarticles = bdb.(verbarticles)
formatted = html_string.(bdbarticles)
```

## A useful function 

This is useful enough that we could wrap it up in a simple function.

```{julia}
"Find BDB articles for a given token that have a given part of speech code."
function posarticles(tkn, poscode)
    plusentries = bdbplus(tkn)
    posarticles = filter(plusentries) do plusentry
        strongs = strong(plusentry)
        !isempty(filter(st -> pos(st) == poscode, strongs))
    end
    bdb.(posarticles)
end
```


```{julia}
posarticles("בָּרָ֣א", "v")
```


## Results

Here are the results of formatting the articles as HTML strings.


### First article

```{julia}
formatted[1] |> HTML
```


### Second article

```{julia}
formatted[2] |> HTML
```
